Description: The t-Digest construction algorithm, by 
    Dunning et al., (2019) <arXiv:1902.04023v1>, uses a variant of 1-dimensional 
    k-means clustering to produce a very compact data structure that allows 
    accurate estimation of quantiles. This t-Digest data structure can be used 
    to estimate quantiles, compute other rank statistics or even to estimate 
    related measures like trimmed means. The advantage of the t-Digest over 
    previous digests for this purpose is that the t-Digest handles data with 
    full floating point resolution. The accuracy of quantile estimates produced 
    by t-Digests can be orders of magnitude more accurate than those produced 
    by previous digest algorithms. Methods are provided to create and update 
    t-Digests and retrieve quantiles from the accumulated distributions.
